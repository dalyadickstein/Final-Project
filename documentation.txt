* GENERAL DESCRIPTION: *
************************
This is a text-based, turn-based, two-player battle game. Two people can play
either on the same computer, in two different terminal windows, or over a local
area network on their own computers. The game is a battle between two mages,
each specializing in a certain element, or "elementalists." Each player chooses
an element (Earth, Fire, Water, or Wind). Each element has differenet moves 
associated with it, from which the users can pick three. The users also pick 
their initial stats (HP, attack, and speed), and then choose moves turn-by-turn
until they knock out the opponent.

********************
* GETTING STARTED: *
********************
Note: This program was initially written using Sublime Text and run on a regular 
terminal. I am not sure whether the CS50 IDE will allow two computers to connect
over LAN when running this program. 

If you would like the program on your own computer, first make sure that you are
running Python3. The program can then be cloned from Github by running the 
following command in your terminal: 
git clone https://github.com/dalyadickstein/Final-Project.git
Then enter the Final Project folder in your terminal and run game.py with the 
command: 
python3 game.py
(at least in a standard terminal - I'm not sure if other terminals call for 
different commands for running Python3 files).

The game will then prompt you to start or join. If you type 'start', you will be
the server, and will be provided with your IP address and port that the client
will have to input. If you type anything other than 'start', the program will
assume you have made a typo and want to join, and will prompt you for the
server's "Host" and "Port" that were just printed to the server's screen. Input
these, and the game will begin.

* GAMEPLAY: *
*************
Choose your element:
You will first be prompted to choose your element. Each element comes with its
own set of moves according to its type (i.e. water-type elementalist will have
water-type moves), plus normal-type moves that all elementalists have. Each type
is strong against one other type and weak against another: Fire is strong
agaisnt wind, wind is strong against earth, earth is strong against water, and
water is strong against fire. (In the same way, fire is weak on water, etc.).
Your opponent will also pick, but you will not betold what your opponent picks.

Choose your stats:
Next you are given five options for sets of stats, which include HP (health/hit
points), attack, and speed. Enter the number for the set you want. Again, you
will not be informed of your opponent's choice.

Choose your moves:
You will finally be prompted to choose your moves out of the moves printed to 
your screen. Each elementalist has its own list of possible choices that include
moves of its type plus normal-type moves. The moves' attack power, speed, types,
and description are printed to the screen. You will be asked to enter your three
choices one by one by typing the name of the move. You may not choose the same 
move twice. 

Battling:
Your three chosen moves will be printed to the screen, with their full 
descriptions. Choose one by typing in its name and hitting enter, as before.
The game will wait until both players have chosen moves, and then will calculate
who moves first by comparing the combined move speed and player speed stat. The
results of each round will be printed to the screen. However, you will only see
the results. You still will not know what choices your opponent made, so you can
have fun figuring it out or just enjoy the mystery. 

You will be prompted to enter your next move, and the next round will commence,
until one player kills the other, upon which the program will announce the 
winner and exit. 

Have fun playing and may the most skilled elementalist win!
